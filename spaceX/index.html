                        Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The airman earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory. To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature; could one dream of anything more?

                        Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but its actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.

                         If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon. As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize theres a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
